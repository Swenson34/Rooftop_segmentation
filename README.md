This report aimes at predicting the segmentation of rooftop on a city to estimate the solar potential by using different models structures shown as above. The main idea to achieve the goal can be divided into three parts in general.

- Data Augmentation

     The images would be rotated from 90 degrees to 180, 270 degrees individually. And the images can also be flipped around x-axis.
  
- Model trainning

     The data would be splited into training set, validation set and testing set. Data-preprocessing would be needed, for instance, one of the most important ways is binarization where we set a threshold= 0.5, because the outputs of those model predicted were in the type of [0.] (float 32). All of these models (U-Net, FCN, and FCN_deep) are deep learning architectures implemented in TensorFlow. 
- Performance evaluation
     The metric IOU would be used to evaluate the model representing the model gerneralization ability.
