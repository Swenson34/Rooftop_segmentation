This report aimes at predicting the segmentation of rooftop on a city to estimate the solar potential by using different models structures shown as above. The main idea to achieve the goal can be divided into three parts in general.

- Data Augmentation

     The images would be rotated from 90 degrees to 180, 270 degrees individually shown in geometric_augmentatiom. And the images can also be flipped around x-axis shown in the function of x_axis_reflection . If you have a large GPU you can try geometric_augmentatiom.
  
- Model trainning

     The data are split into training, validation, and testing sets. Data preprocessing is required; for example, one important step is binarization by setting a threshold of 0.5, because the model outputs are floating-point predictions in the range [0, 1]. All of these models (U-Net, FCN, and FCN_deep) are deep learning architectures implemented in TensorFlow.
   
- Performance evaluation
  
     The IoU metric (Intersection over Union) is used to evaluate the performance of the segmentation model, reflecting how well it generalizes to unseen data.
